# ProjectTrace - Product Brief

**Antler Hackathon Submission | October 2025**

---

## The Problem

Every project generates thousands of emails and calendar events. **Nobody knows what actually happened.**

Project teams struggle to answer basic questions:
- When did we pivot strategy? 
- Who influenced key decisions?
- Which collaboration periods were most productive?
- When did knowledge transfer between team members?

Manual timeline reconstruction takes weeks. Collaboration patterns remain invisible. Learning from past projects is impossible.

---

## The Solution

**ProjectTrace** turns email + calendar data into instant project intelligence using a multi-agent AI system.

Drop in your data ‚Üí Get complete project analysis in **7 seconds**.

### What It Does

**6 AI Agents analyze collaboration patterns simultaneously:**

üî• **Burst Detector** - Finds intense collaboration periods  
üéØ **Milestone Finder** - Identifies key project events  
üîÑ **Phase Mapper** - Detects strategic pivots using topic modeling  
üí¨ **Sentiment Analyzer** - Tracks communication patterns (12+ metrics)  
üèÜ **Influence Scorer** - Ranks who actually drives decisions (PageRank)  
ü§ù **Handoff Tracker** - Maps knowledge transfer between team members

**Zero configuration. Zero manual tagging. Just insights.**

## How It Works

```
Email + Calendar JSON ‚Üí Graph Construction ‚Üí 6 AI Agents ‚Üí Interactive Dashboard
```

**Tech:** Python, NetworkX (graph engine), TF-IDF (topic modeling), Streamlit (dashboard)  
**Speed:** Analyzes 3+ years of project data in ~7 seconds  
**Output:** 12 data files + interactive 6-tab dashboard

## Proof: Real Project Analysis

**Dataset:** 3.67-year consulting project (Aug 2022 - Apr 2026)
- 47 events (27 emails + 20 meetings)
- 42 participants across 5+ organizations
- 1,340 days reconstructed automatically

**Results:**
- ‚úÖ 7 collaboration bursts detected (66% avg confidence)
- ‚úÖ 8 milestones identified (72.5% confidence) 
- ‚úÖ 4 strategic pivots mapped (93% topic shift)
- ‚úÖ 42 influence rankings calculated
- ‚úÖ 38 team handoffs tracked
- ‚úÖ Crisis periods auto-detected (12.8% of events)

**Impact:** Weeks of manual work ‚Üí 7 seconds automated

## Why This Matters

**Billions of emails and meetings happen daily. Almost none of it becomes organizational knowledge.**

ProjectTrace changes that. It's not just analytics‚Äîit's **automated project memory** that helps teams understand what actually happened, who drove it, and how to do it better next time.

**Built in 2025. Ready to ship. Let's turn communication data into competitive advantage.**
