Hi Terry, I will be sharing weekly financial performance reports with you and Lennon on Sunday so you are aware of any upcoming payment processing implementations. For access to ALL pending payment processing deployments, you can check the financial workflow dashboard easier. Regarding the *monthly processed transaction volume* please find them below: - June= 2,000,000 - 2,100,000 Currency - July= 900,000 - 950,000 Currency - August= Expected 2,000,000 Currency (if we secure a major new account, a large corporation and another enterprise client) Thanks!

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Hi Terry Palmer, July was low because 10 days were off and all clients are taking a really long time to get out of Holiday Season mood. All lost projects were because of three main reasons, maybe we can revisit them: 1. Clients ask us to pitch for design and branding services while we don't pitch. 2. Prices are too high, not in the client's budget. 3. Timeframe too slow and kick off dates too late. This is not a problem anymore since the design team should have more capacity starting September, same for strategy team. Another way we can get more work can be: 1. To have a discussion with existing clients before the project end date regarding other challenges they are facing to see how we can help them fix it. They might need support in areas like financial efficiency, transaction analysis, market strategies, payment solutions, or design. 2. Share a list of target companies with ConsultingCo's team to facilitate introductions. Let me know your thoughts.

Hi Hollis Murray and Lennon, I hope you're both doing great! Thanks for sharing all this. Please find below feedback regarding the payment platform integration workshop: * All team members involved are US based (Sunday is a weekend, 6/9 is labor day). Can we aim for the 7th or 8th? * What will be the duration of the workshop? I'd appreciate if we can start it as late as possible, as two of our team members are on the West Coast, presenting a 9-hour time difference. Regarding the proposal for streamlining financial operations: * I think the presentation and invoice templates are missing. * Can you please send it via DocuSign or any e-signature platform? Happy to send it from my account if easier. * Do you need our registration papers here in the US? Thanks again. Really excited to kickstart our partnership in optimizing payment workflows!

Hey Avery Young, Thanks for sharing this updated project timeline. Some questions below. In my previous email, I requested an 8am PT kickoff. Can you please confirm this is still feasible? A few questions: * Regarding the period from 7/9 to 1/10, will we receive any progress reports or detailed specifications? * How many potential workflows will be presented? * In the event we require adjustments, what's the expected turnaround time? Finally, as I communicated to Peyton, I'm concerned about the week's delay given Hollis Murray's initial dates, especially since the project hasn't officially begun. I hope to avoid further delays as we integrate the fintech solution. Best, Jamie Adams

Good day, Jamie Adams. This is Oakley Brooks, Brand Strategy and Insights Manager at ConsultingCo. We're pleased to begin with the Brand Strategy workshop scheduled for September 7th. Ahead of the workshop, please find attached the workshop workbook. It contains the agenda and a detailed overview of topics we'll be covering. To ensure a productive workshop, we've outlined a few key questions below: What's your primary revenue model and what value does it offer your clients? What are your key performance indicators (KPIs) and recent growth metrics since launching StartupCo.com? What are the main obstacles to optimizing your financial operations? Who are your main competitors in the payment processing and financial software space? Describe your ideal client profile in terms of industry, transaction volume, and financial complexity. How do your clients currently manage their payments and invoicing processes? What is your current payment processing setup and average transaction size? We look forward to your response. Thank you, Oakley Brooks

Hi Jamie Adams, I hope you found the meeting to be as productive and efficient as we did! Kindly find attached the timeline for this project, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Best, Avery Young

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Hi Avery Young, We're very pleased with the progress. Thanks so much for all the ConsultingCo team for making it a productive experience. I spoke with Terry Palmer regarding the delay in receiving the deliverables, specifically the branding guide. Our agreement stated delivery in early November. As a rapidly expanding fintech company, adherence to this timeline is critical to maintain our operational efficiency. Terry assured me he'd investigate. Thanks again! We anticipate seeing the results of the workshop. Best, Jamie Adams

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Hi Jamie Adams, Fantastic! As per the proposal, the implementation guidelines take 8-10 weeks to complete once the Platform Specifications are approved. We will definitely do our very best to shorten this period or find another solution that works for both of us. I will keep you updated accordingly and in the meantime please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Hi Terry Palmer, Taylor can't track the transaction in our system, that’s why we requested the transaction confirmation. Anyway, we’re expediting the implementation and will brief the financial operations team on Tuesday.

Terry Palmer, We never communicated that payment integration would take a month. The contract outlines a multi-week implementation timeline following system approval, which takes 3 weeks from the initial financial strategy. We don't guarantee a 4-week payment solution deployment.

Lets discuss before we reply. Things like very disappointed and regret working with ConsultingCo really kill me - especially given the financial solutions are optimized. I really want his company to have a smooth experience and for us to be reliable partners in streamlining his financial operations but I also want us to take the time needed to do amazing work. All the best, Terry Palmer

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Hey Jamie Adams, I'm slightly surprised to receive this email after Thursday's demonstration. The difference between this week and the 19th is just a few days. That's ample time to implement the necessary payment configurations. We'll never want you to regret working with ConsultingCo - and to be honest, I can't see anything about what we've done so far that would leave you less than delighted. Our time frames are a bit long, but they are generally very reasonable given the level of sophistication and precision in our implementation. It seems that there was a misunderstanding at some point about the deadlines for the deliverables, and I apologize for that. When all is said and done (and I promise that we will make sure that will be sooner rather than later) StartupCo will be well-positioned for success with a streamlined payment workflow solution. I will discuss the timeline with the team and will see what can be done - but I assure you that we are working at a very good pBusinessSchool to try to optimize your transaction processing before a key business period. We're maintaining strong progress and will continue to deliver a highly effective payment processing solution for you. Have a great day and lets talk soon. All the best, Terry Palmer

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Hi Avery Young, Thanks for the update. We can do same time like last Thursday (11am ET) Does that time still work for discussing the invoice management system updates? Thanks again, Jamie Adams

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Hi Terry Palmer, Thanks for sharing this. I appreciate the context. However, the delays in delivery are impacting our ability to plan effectively. The repeated extensions are becoming a concern. From our initial discussions, we stressed the importance of timely delivery. As a company, the timeline is crucial for achieving our financial goals, and even small delays significantly impact our operations, especially given the cumulative effect of previous extensions. As a reminder, we proceeded based on the understanding that the initial version would be delivered by September 24th. The proposed October 19th deadline represents a significant delay. Regarding our work with the MarketingFirm on StartupCo. We are managing multiple projects simultaneously. Our web developer, initially scheduled for the week of October 4th, is now unavailable for the next two weeks, adding to the complexity. To maintain a positive working relationship, we've ensured prompt payment despite the scheduling challenges. Finally, Given your experience with similar projects, it would have been beneficial to have more realistic timeline expectations set from the outset, especially considering our emphasis on meeting deadlines. That said, we appreciate the effort the ConsultingCo team is putting into the project, and we look forward to reviewing the next iteration this Thursday. Best, Jamie Adams

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

FYI. All the best, Terry Palmer

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

We totally appreciate the importance of every day in the world of a tech startup. We will continue to do our very best to turn things around for you quickly, and at the standard that we can be proud of. Im certain that there was an early misalignment on timings that we are still trying to recover from. Rest assured that we are working hard to make up for any lost time. Update on Thursday!! All the best, Terry Palmer p.s. Your feedback was clear and helpful, I think well definitely have a winning direction by Thursday with different platform designs and hopefully another one with a refined financial workflow.

Hi Terry Palmer, Unfortunately, it will be at least 2-3 weeks till the platform engineer is available again. So there is no point rushing the team if we’ll have a better outcome on Tuesday.

Hi Jamie Adams, We'll definitely take the extra time to see how we can make the work even better. I think we're very close to having two excellent options.

Hi Terry Palmer, One of the financial workflows is an idea I thought could be very nice if executed well. I'm not married to it, though. Btw, a couple of folks we showed the financial data presentation commented that the payment solution could be slightly off and that there could be an opportunity for optimization there. I thought I'd share in case helpful. Excited to see the outcome on Tuesday. Best, Jamie Adams

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Interesting point about feedback All the best, Terry Palmer

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Thanks Jamie Adams, Good points. Will share the transaction data comment with the team. I guess StartupCo emphasizes efficient financial workflows, and we've tried to balance that by emphasizing operational excellence. I suspect that there might be a way to show payment processing and data reconciliation together in a way that works. All the best, Terry Palmer

Honestly, I don’t know what to say. I reviewed Avery Young's account twice in the past week and I informed her that Jamie Adams is experiencing payment processing delays again - and he did. It is disappointing that all this hard work optimizing their transactions will end up not even securing this client's complete satisfaction with our payment platform. I need to know who is managing this account and who will resolve this payment issue - and how I can assist.

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

P.S. from Jamie Adams “ Please add the email newsletter to the list of deliverables regarding financial reporting.”

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Honestly, I don’t know what to say. I've reviewed the Adams account details with Avery Young twice this week, and I flagged that payment reconciliation issues were escalating - and they have. It's disappointing that all our efforts to streamline their payment workflows haven't resulted in improved client satisfaction. I need to understand ownership of this account and the plan for resolving the reconciliation challenges. How can I assist?

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

I wanna say a few things about this… 1. We NEVER present final deliverables in concept presentations. We present platform directions , interface concepts and user experience on some of the deliverables. We don’t work on specific deliverables as if he’a launching tomorrow for several platform options. When he chooses a direction we work on the deliverables in detail. So we needed to set expectations here from the beginning or as we go along, cause this client obviously doesn’t get this when he expects to see specialized modules for every platform direction or financial report for example for all the different platform concepts. 2. We did everything requested of us in the recap sent on a project management software. Not sure why we never received the rest of the requests. And no one told us not to include a standardized interface again, and two of the new directions that are approved for the next presentation do include a standardized interface. 3. We show the dashboard user experience for every platform direction every single time. If he is looking for a a fully designed homepage for multiple platform options, that’s not gonna happen. When he chooses a platform direction we should start working on it properly. This is becoming really frustrating, we are putting a lot of effort into the work and for some reason his expectations are never met, because they are not set properly. Thanks Taylor Parker

Hey Avery Young, Thanks for sharing this. Two quick comments/questions: * I think the original platform design was a streamlined interface, right? I think we like that more than the purple. It would be great if you can add it to the presentation deck you shared. * I think the company mark is smaller in the attachment? I think the initial dimensions were better too Please share what we agreed on with you and Chris on Sunday. But just so you know where we're at: 99% going with the original platform design (abstract symbol). I think other firms in the payment processing sector have logos, but what we have here is a strong brand identity and I don't want to compromise that. We'll make it our own. Have a great weekend all!

Please incorporate the following points of feedback: - use a primary brand color for platform and UI elements (see #1 & #2 below) - use a contrasting brand accent color for charts and data visualizations (see #2 and #3) - please show us different colour combinations (with accent colors) for the financial dashboards? (ie. the two on the right of #4 works well, #3 needs improvement) *1.* [image: 1.png] *2. * [image: 2.png] *3.* [image: 3.png] *4.* [image: 4.png]

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

To clarify my last feedback bullet: *""- please show us different visual themes for the transaction element ad screens? (ie. the two on the right of #4 is quite strong, #3 is not quite there)""* Please give us a version of #4 where the specific transaction visuals are replaced with alternate visuals, using the existing style already in #4. I'm curious to see if we can use both alternate transaction visuals on different occasions. Thanks, Sam Stone

Hi Jamie Adams, I hope this email finds you well. I know we agreed we'd share the implementation roadmap today, but unfortunately we're still finalizing the integration plan internally, as multiple departments are now involved in ensuring smooth payment workflow compatibility. I will be sharing with you next steps and timelines tomorrow, please let me know if you have any questions regarding the proposed automated reconciliation process! Best, Avery Young

Hi Jamie Adams, Hope this email finds you well! I have just shared with you a shared Harper Doc with all the agreed upon deliverables and their deadlines. The amends on the digital assets along with the new additions will be shared Wednesday, November 24th in both XD and preview format, noting that those including the new icons will be dummy mock-ups which your web designer can change once we share the full library of icons (which will be shared on Sunday, November 28th). We will work on the rest of the deliverables at the bottom of the table once we finalize the above. Please let me know if you have any questions! Best, Avery Young

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Hi Avery, We're not okay with the current invoice processing delays nor with not having a timeline for almost 60-70% financial workflows. Plus, the payment automation implementations should be almost done. Why are we experiencing these delays? I'd appreciate if you can come back to us with a revised timeline. Thanks, Jamie Adams

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Hi Sam Stone, Hope all is great! Please note that we will share with you the payment platform in XD format today and are currently working on the platform interface in XD format as well so we would rather continue as is so that the files are not confusing at the end. Having said that, the below platform interface pages (old and new additional pages) will be ready by Wednesday in XD format. - Dashboard view - Financial Insights (Can you please share with us mockups to ensure alignment) - Placeholder screens (We will share with you 3 placeholder screens; Scenario 1, Scenario 2, and Scenario 3) - The look and feel of the following platform interface pages, please note that the content of these pages will be dummy as this will be considered a template/guide for when developing the actual platform interface pages; - About us - Payment workflow examples - Success stories - API Documentation - Partner Network As for the swag design concepts, we will share them with you tomorrow by EOD. Finally, the below 3 types of Email campaign templates (dummy content as well) will be shared with you on Wednesday along with the platform interface; - Major Company announcement - Email updates - Platform Updates Thank you, Hayden Evans Brand Development Sr. Manager *Email:* hayden.evans@ConsultingCo.com *Cell:* +1-555-0100

Thank you Avery Young! The marketing material concepts are looking great. I'm loving those branded documentation! Could we also get a look and feel for the marketing material concepts on: - product branding stickers - branded pens - branded t-shirts - branded masks - branded socks (see examples <https://dummy.example.com/social> and <https://fairware.com/blog-hootsuite-custom-owly-socks/>) - a promotional material box <https://swag.com/in-a-box?utm_campaign=Snack%20Nation%20&utm_source=Blog&utm_medium=CompanySwag> And also, the protective phone cases are quite visually striking -- could you show us a version on a white background that is less overly bold?

Hi Jamie Adams and Sam Stone, Noted. You will have the compiled financial report the soonest possible.

Hi Hayden Evans, Thanks for the quick turn around. A couple of small comments: * The pdf is missing information * The StartupCo platform icon and its screenshot next to other apps doesn't match the current branding guidelines. Can you send an updated PDF over the next 30-45minutes, please? Best, Jamie Adams

Hi Jamie Adams, We didn't add the platform launch on purpose given that we're still working on it and will share it with you tomorrow, so we can either wait till tomorrow and share with you the final presentation with the platform launch and marketing rollout or add what we previously had and send to you right away? As for the platform design, we will amend the presentation and send it right away, but to make sure there is no confusion, can you please confirm that the attached design mockup is approved.

Thank you Avery Young and team. Things are coming together nicely. Could you also send (in a separate file) a full page mock of the platform dashboard? It's hard for me to get a good sense of the user experience with the workflows presented across multiple sections in the presentation. Same with the platform interface design.

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Hi Avery Young, The presentation did give me a better sense of the overall design of the dashboard. Is it possible for you to export what you had in the working mock into a single long PDF for us to see it all in one view? Also, as discussed in our meeting, I'm attaching a recent email design from a contractor with no design guidelines. It would be extremely useful for your team to redesign this invoice template with the updated style guide -- so that we can provide a sample with guidance and template on things like layout, fonts, and branding elements for any future work. Thanks, Sam Stone [image: Template_Mockup.png]

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Hi Jamie Adams, Of course, any time! Kindly find attached the updated deck with the new project updates and marketing materials.

Hi Jamie Adams, Hope your weekend is going well! Kindly find the first set of initial dashboard designs. Please let us know your thoughts so we can proceed with the next set. Thanks in advance! Best, Avery Young

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Hi Jamie Adams, I hope your week's off to a good start so far. This is just to recap on the following deliverables we shared last week: - Payment Module Development - Payment Portal Design - Automated Invoice Notifications - Branding Materials - Abstract Visuals Please note that we are pending your feedback/approval to proceed accordingly. Based on the project plan, we'll move to the second integration phase upon successful completion of the initial payment gateway setup. Thanks in advance! Best, Avery Young

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Hi Avery Young, Thanks for the recap. The designs are looking great and are giving us lots of ideas. A couple notes of feedback and clarifications: - platform interface -- Can we get a design for a main component that allows a visitor to navigate different aspects of the platform? see generic website examples below - payment processing module -- we're missing the web app design sample for users exploring the transaction history (see (3) below) - mini-illustrations -- It is more important that we prioritize mini-illustrations that could be used as 'visual elements for marketing purposes' on platform website, emails, presentations, etc. (see highlighted examples from our platform website (4) below), rather than focusing on the module icons for payment actions right now. - email templates -- Can the team provide the new-brand version of the email design I shared last time? As discussed, having that sample converted into the new brand look will go a long way to getting a unified visual identity from our contract designers. - color palette -- Can you provide generic color scheme suggestions for the various color variants? Also, the color code on page 10 for text is a purple, not black - primary color gradient -- Can you provide example gradients for our review? Also, as we had mentioned a while back, direction is fully approved and there's no need to wait for further approvals before proceeding with the deliverables -- we really need to get a move on with other deliverables like document designs, presentation master templates, social cover pages, app store listing designs, etc. Please continue to send over each set as conceptualized to get feedback rather than waiting to send them all at once. Thanks and keep up the great work!

So we need a strategic review or a market analysis? Or a short call to iron out any ambiguities in their requirements? I don't believe we should proceed without thoroughly validating their proposed financial workflows; their strategy needs to be bulletproof. Best, Terry Palmer

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Hi Team, After checking out the brief, it is clear that they only need platform branding, not market positioning due to the provided information (strategy section), listed deliverables, and time constraint. [image: abstract_symbol.png] I think including a market positioning will make it seem like we didn't read the brief well. So, in terms of deliverables, I was thinking of just including two options: one style guide with logo + platform assets, and one complete platform guidelines. The proposal will contain an executive summary, the project deliverables, pricing tiers, and project schedule.

Yes I think this should be positioned as what we need to do to get to our payment workflow implementation and not expanding the financial processing module. We can conduct a review session to finalize the transaction processing parameters efficiently. What do you think?

I think a 20-30% processing fee increase is a significant jump. We should offer tiered payment processing options to cater to varied transaction volumes and client requirements. All the best, Terry Palmer

Hey Reese – these are awesome! Great job! We have some minor feedback on a few of them but generally we really like them. Leandro, our designer, is putting them in a design collaboration platform now to make it easier to leave our comments and I'll share it shortly. The team missed a few from the website, though: * Key Modules We also want some more icons, please: * Approved / Processed (Like a checkmark maybe?) * Processing Indicator * different status icons (success, failure, pending maybe) * Financial Analysis Icon * Business Network Icon (see reference on figma) * Reporting Region *Important request:* can you send the ai files asap, please? We want to try them on the designs. We need the lines in stroke, so please don't convert them to outline. Thanks again! Great work! Best, Jamie Adams

---EMAIL SEPARATOR---

Hi Sage Harris, Great connecting with you! And thank for sharing the design files. Here is a Figma ( https://example.com/file-link ) file with the comments and missing items. The LinkedIn and Twitter cover pages weren't delivered either.  We're targeting next month for launch. Can you please deliver them by the 15th? The more critical issue, though, is a graphic I discussed with Chris today with visual elements (I understand this won't count as 1 graphic) as well as the additional icons I shared yesterday. They're for a product demo, so we need them ASAP for the design team to finalize them and deliver on time. These are the icons I'm referring to btw: * Transaction Approved (checkmark icon) * Processing Time * different status indicators (success, pending, error) * Audit Log * circular logo featuring payment flows (see reference on figma) * Transaction Origin Chris will follow up with you and the team. We'd greatly appreciate ConsultingCo's support on this one, please. Thanks again! Best, Jamie Adams
