## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### Architecture Overview

```
Data Ingestion → Preprocessing → Graph Construction → Multi-Agent Analysis → Visualization
     (JSON)     → (Pydantic)   → (NetworkX)        → (6 Agents)          → (Streamlit)
```

### 1. **Data Preprocessing** (`src/data/preprocessor.py`)

**Input Processing:**

- Raw JSON files: `Antler_Hackathon_Email_Data.json` + `Antler_Hackathon_Calendar_Data.json`
- Validation: Pydantic schemas with error handling (1 malformed thread skipped)
- Timezone normalization: All timestamps converted to UTC
- Deduplication: Removed duplicate participant entries

**Output Statistics:**

- ✅ **47 total events** (27 emails + 20 meetings)
- ✅ **42 unique participants** across 5+ organizations
- ✅ **1,340-day timeline** (2022-08-05 to 2026-04-06)
- ✅ **Participant statistics CSV** with email/meeting breakdowns

**Top 5 Most Active Participants:**

1. **terry.palmer@consultingco.com** (Consultingco) - 43 events (23E, 20M)
2. **jamie.adams@startupco.com** (Startupco) - 29 events (15E, 14M)
3. **hayden.moore@consultingco.com** (Consultingco) - 21 events (10E, 11M)
4. **taylor.parker@consultingco.com** (Consultingco) - 17 events (9E, 8M)
5. **hayden.evans@consultingco.com** (Consultingco) - 15 events (7E, 8M)

### 2. **Graph Construction** (`src/models/graph_builder.py`)

**Graph Architecture:**

- **Multi-layer NetworkX graph** with typed nodes and edges
- **Node types:** Person nodes (42) + Event nodes (47) = 89 total
- **Edge types:**
  - Participation edges (person ↔ event)
  - Temporal edges (event → event)
  - Collaboration edges (person ↔ person, implicit)

**Graph Metrics (Fresh from Latest Run):**

```
Total Nodes:     89
├─ People:       42
└─ Events:       47

Total Edges:     956
├─ Participation: 936
└─ Temporal:     20

Graph Density:   0.1221
Average Degree:  21.48
```

**Key Insights:**

- High density (0.12) indicates strong collaboration network
- Average degree of 21.5 means each node connects to ~24% of network
- 20 temporal links create chronological event sequence

### 3. **Multi-Agent Analysis System**

Six specialized analysis agents working in parallel:

#### **Agent 1: Adaptive Burst Detector** (`src/analysis/burst_detector.py`)

**Innovation:** Dynamic parameter tuning based on data density

**Algorithm:**

```python
1. Calculate dataset density: events / total_days = 0.035 events/day
2. Adapt parameters based on density:
   - Sparse data (< 0.1): window = 720 hours (30 days)
   - Dense data (> 0.5): window = 168 hours (7 days)
3. Sliding window analysis with min_events threshold
4. Confidence scoring based on:
   - Event concentration
   - Participant diversity
   - Temporal clustering
```

**Results from Fresh Run:**

- **7 Collaboration Bursts** detected
- Average confidence: **66.2%**
- Largest burst: **19 participants** (October 2022)
- Longest burst: **680 hours** (~28 days)

**Top 3 Bursts:**

| Period                | Duration | Events     | Participants | Confidence |
| --------------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Aug 5 - Sep 2, 2022   | 680 hrs  | 5 (4E, 1M) | 13           | 70.0%      |
| Oct 19 - Nov 11, 2022 | 553 hrs  | 7 (4E, 3M) | 19           | 68.5%      |
| Nov 10 - Dec 8, 2022  | 655 hrs  | 4 (3E, 1M) | 12           | 64.3%      |

1. **Decision Points** - Large meetings + follow-up activity + subsequent calm
2. **Deliverables** - Keywords: presentation, demo, launch, release
3. **Planning Phases** - Keywords: workshop, strategy, planning, briefing

**Confidence Scoring Formula:**

```
confidence = (participant_weight × 0.4) + (keyword_weight × 0.3) + (followup_weight × 0.3)
```

**Results from Fresh Run:**

- **8 Total Milestones** detected
  - 0 Decision Points
  - **4 Deliverables** (avg confidence: 72.5%)

#### **Agent 3: Phase Transition Detector** (`src/analysis/phase_detector.py`)

**Algorithm:** TF-IDF topic modeling with Jaccard similarity

**Process:**

```
1. Create 30-day sliding windows across timeline
2. Extract top keywords using TF-IDF (5 keywords per window)
3. Calculate Jaccard similarity between consecutive windows
4. Detect transitions when similarity < 0.4 (60% topic shift)
5. Name phases based on dominant keywords
```

**Results from Fresh Run:**

- **4 Phase Transitions** detected
- Average confidence: **79.6%**
- Average topic shift: **7.1% similarity** (92.9% change)

### 7. **Influence Scores** (`influence_scores.csv`)

#### **Algorithm**

We build a **person-to-person subgraph** where edge weights = number of shared events, then calculate:

1. **PageRank:** Influence through network position
2. **Degree Centrality:** Direct connections
3. **Betweenness Centrality:** Bridge between groups

Then classify into 4 roles:

- **Active Leader:** High influence + high activity
- **Strategic Leader:** High influence + low activity
- **Executor:** Low influence + high activity
- **Contributor:** Low influence + low activity

#### **Top 10 Influencers**

| Rank | Participant                    | Role        | Events | Organization |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ----------- | ------ | ------------ |
| 1    | oakley.brooks@consultingco.com | Executor    | 15     | ConsultingCo |
| 2    | hayden.moore@consultingco.com  | Executor    | 21     | ConsultingCo |
| 3    | skylar.stone@consultingco.com  | Contributor | 3      | ConsultingCo |
| 4    | bailey.taylor@consultingco.com | Contributor | 1      | ConsultingCo |
| 5    | arden.wilson@consultingco.com  | Contributor | 4      | ConsultingCo |
| 9    | taylor.parker@consultingco.com | Executor    | 17     | ConsultingCo |

**Critical Observation:**
All top influencers have identical PageRank (0.0238) - this indicates the network structure is **highly egalitarian** with no single bottleneck or gatekeeper.

**Team Structure Inference:**

- **Executors dominate:** People like Hayden Moore (21 events) drive work through participation, not control
- **No Strategic Leaders:** No one has high influence with low activity - collaborative hands-on culture
- **ConsultingCo-Heavy:** Top ranks dominated by consulting firm, indicating they led the engagement

---

### 8. **Handoff Detection** (`handoffs.csv`)

#### **What We Track**

- **Gap Resumptions:** 14+ day silence followed by activity
- **Team Expansions:** 2+ new participants joining
- **High Turnover:** >70% participant change between consecutive events
- **Departures:** Members leaving project

#### **Insights**

The system detected multiple handoff patterns across the 1,340-day timeline, with notable gaps indicating:
