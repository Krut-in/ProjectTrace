## 🕸️ Network Graph Construction

### Implementation Approach

We built a **multi-layer NetworkX graph** where:
- **Person nodes (42):** Represent individuals with organization metadata
- **Event nodes (47):** Emails and meetings with timestamps
- **Edges (956):** Person-to-event participation links
- **Temporal links (20):** Sequential event connections

### Graph Statistics

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 89,
  "total_edges": 956,
  "person_nodes": 42,
  "event_nodes": 47,
  "density": 0.1221,
  "avg_degree": 21.48
}
```

### What This Tells Us

**Network Density (0.122):** The graph is neither too sparse nor too dense - a healthy collaboration structure where people connect through shared events without bottlenecks.

**Average Degree (21.5):** Each participant connects to ~21 events on average, indicating consistent engagement across the timeline.

## 🔥 Collaboration Burst Detection

### The Innovation

Traditional burst detection uses **fixed parameters** (e.g., "5+ events in 7 days"), which fails on irregular data. Our **adaptive algorithm** calculates optimal parameters based on dataset density:

```python
density = events / timeline_days
if density < 0.1:   # Sparse data like ours
    window = 30 days
    min_events = 3
elif density < 0.5:  # Medium density
    window = 14 days
    min_events = 5
else:                # Dense data
    window = 7 days
    min_events = 8
```

**Result:** System auto-tuned to 30-day windows and 3-event minimum for our episodic collaboration pattern.

### Detected Bursts

| Burst | Period | Duration | Events | Participants | Confidence |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|--------------|------------|
| #1 | Aug 5 - Sep 2, 2022 | 680 hrs | 5 | 13 | 70% |
| #2 | Oct 19 - Nov 11, 2022 | 553 hrs | 7 | **19** | 69% |
| #3 | Nov 10 - Dec 8, 2022 | 655 hrs | 4 | 12 | 64% |
| #4 | Jan 4 - Jan 21, 2023 | 389 hrs | 4 | 6 | 68% |
| #5 | Sep 15 - Oct 10, 2023 | 598 hrs | 3 | 6 | 52% |
| #6 | Jun 7 - Jun 13, 2024 | 139 hrs | 3 | 4 | 66% |
| #7 | Mar 10 - Apr 6, 2026 | 650 hrs | 3 | 7 | 67% |

### Analysis

**🚀 Peak Activity:** Burst #2 (Oct-Nov 2022) involved 19 participants - the entire team synchronized for likely project kickoff/delivery.

**📉 Declining Participation:** Later bursts (2023-2026) show fewer participants (3-7), indicating transition to maintenance or specialized work.

**⏳ Long Gaps:** 9-month gap between Burst #5 and #6 confirms episodic consulting engagement model, not continuous development.

**🎯 Confidence Scores:** Avg 66% confidence across all bursts - system is reasonably certain these are genuine collaboration peaks, not noise.

## 🎯 Milestone Detection

### Detection Strategy

Milestones aren't manually tagged - we **infer them from behavioral patterns**:

1. **Deliverables:** Keywords like "presentation", "demo", "review" + cross-org attendance
2. **Planning Phases:** "workshop", "strategy", "briefing" + follow-up activity  
3. **Decision Points:** Large meetings + immediate follow-ups + calm period after

Each milestone gets a confidence score based on:
- Participant count (more people = higher confidence)
- Follow-up activity density (planning should trigger work)
- Keyword strength (multiple keywords = stronger signal)

### Detected Milestones

**8 milestones found:**

#### Deliverables (4)

| Date | Event | Participants | Confidence |
|------|-------|--------------|------------|
| Sep 20, 2022 | ConsultingCo // StartupCo demo | 8 | 69% |
| Oct 7, 2022 | Brand Identity & Strategy Presentation | 13 | **75%** |
| Oct 19, 2022 | Brand Identity Presentation | 15 | **75%** |
| Nov 2, 2022 | Brand Identity Presentation | 16 | **75%** |

#### Planning Phases (4)

| Date | Event | Participants | Confidence |
|------|-------|--------------|------------|
| Sep 5, 2022 | StartupCo Workshop Discussion | 4 | 36% |
| Sep 7, 2022 | Brand Strategy Workshop | 10 | 71% |
| Sep 14, 2022 | StartupCo Briefing Session | 15 | 56% |
| Nov 10, 2022 | StartupCo Brand Strategy | 11 | 54% |

#### Decision Points (0)

No decision-point milestones detected (would require large meeting + extended calm period).

### Key Insights

**🎨 Iterative Design Process:** Three "Brand Identity Presentations" in Oct-Nov 2022 show ConsultingCo used feedback loops - present, gather input, refine, repeat.

**📋 Planning-Heavy Start:** September 2022 had 3 planning events (workshop, briefing) before first deliverable in Oct - proper foundation setting.

**👥 Growing Audiences:** Presentation attendance grew from 13 → 15 → 16 participants, suggesting stakeholder expansion or increased buy-in.

**🎯 High-Confidence Deliverables:** 75% confidence on brand presentations indicates strong keyword+participation signals.

**❌ No Crisis Decisions:** Absence of decision-point milestones suggests smooth execution without emergency pivots.

## 🔄 Phase Transition Detection

### Methodology

We use **TF-IDF topic modeling** to detect when project focus shifts:

1. Create 30-day sliding windows across timeline
2. Extract top 5 keywords from each window using TF-IDF
3. Calculate Jaccard similarity between consecutive windows
4. Similarity < 40% = Phase transition detected
5. Name phases based on dominant keywords

### Detected Transitions

| Date | Previous Phase | New Phase | Similarity | Confidence | Topic Shift |
|------|---------------|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Aug 22, 2022 | Design | Planning | 17.6% | 85% | 82% shift |
| Jan 4, 2023 | Design | Scoping | 5.3% | 79% | 95% shift |
| Sep 15, 2023 | Small Favor | Opinion Important | 0.0% | 77% | 100% shift |
| Jun 7, 2024 | Opinion Important | Design | 5.6% | 76% | 94% shift |

### Phase Details

#### Phase 1 → 2: Design to Planning (Aug 2022)
- **Old Keywords:** startupco, consultingco, brand, weekly highlights
- **New Keywords:** workshop, consultingco startupco, brand, strategy
- **What Happened:** Transitioned from initial design discussions to structured planning workshops

#### Phase 2 → 3: Design to Scoping (Jan 2023)
- **Old Keywords:** startupco, strategy, brand strategy
- **New Keywords:** small favor, scope, startupco scope
- **What Happened:** Main project paused, shifted to smaller scoping work

#### Phase 3 → 4: Small Favor to Opinion Important (Sep 2023)
- **Old Keywords:** small favor
- **New Keywords:** opinion important, startupco social
- **What Happened:** Complete topic change - moved to social media/opinion work (100% shift!)

#### Phase 4 → 1: Opinion Important back to Design (Jun 2024)
- **Old Keywords:** opinion important, startupco social
- **New Keywords:** startupco interactive, interactive brand, identity
- **What Happened:** Returned to design work - cyclical project structure

### Insights

**🔁 Non-Linear Project:** This wasn't waterfall (plan → execute → deliver). Teams cycled between design, planning, and specialized work based on needs.

**📉 Low Similarity Scores:** Average 7% similarity between phases = each phase was **distinctly different** work, not gradual evolution.

**🎯 High Confidence:** Average 79% confidence - system is certain these are real transitions, not noise.

**⏰ Long Phase Durations:** Phases lasted 4-9 months, indicating major work blocks, not frequent task switching.

**📊 Phase Naming:** Auto-generated names like "Small Favor", "Opinion Important" come directly from email keywords - reveals actual work vocabulary.

## 🏆 Influence Mapping & Role Classification

### Algorithm

We build a **person-to-person subgraph** where edge weights = number of shared events, then calculate:

1. **PageRank:** Influence through network position (Google's algorithm)
2. **Degree Centrality:** Direct connections count
3. **Betweenness Centrality:** Bridge between groups

Then classify into 4 roles based on influence × activity matrix:

```
           High Activity  |  Low Activity
High      Active Leader  | Strategic Leader
Influence                 |
Low       Executor       | Contributor
Influence                |
```
