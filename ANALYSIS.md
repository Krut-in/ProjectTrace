## üéØ Project Aim & Goal

### The Challenge

Modern project teams generate massive amounts of communication data through emails and calendar events. Understanding who worked on what, when collaboration peaked, and how influence flowed through the team is nearly impossible without automated analysis.

### Our Solution

We built a **production-ready multi-agent graph system** that automatically reconstructs project timelines, detects collaboration patterns, identifies key milestones, and maps influence networks from raw email and calendar data.

### Key Objectives

1. **Unified Timeline Construction** - Merge disparate communication channels into one coherent timeline
2. **Collaboration Pattern Detection** - Identify when teams worked intensely together
3. **Milestone Discovery** - Automatically detect key project events and deliverables
4. **Phase Transition Analysis** - Understand how projects evolved through different stages
5. **Influence Mapping** - Identify key influencers and their roles
6. **Interactive Visualization** - Provide actionable insights through a dashboard

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach

### Architecture Overview

```
Data Ingestion ‚Üí Preprocessing ‚Üí Graph Construction ‚Üí Multi-Agent Analysis ‚Üí Visualization
```

### 1. **Data Preprocessing** (`src/data/preprocessor.py`)

- **Input:** Raw JSON files with email threads and calendar events
- **Process:** Validation using Pydantic schemas, timezone normalization, deduplication
- **Output:** Clean, structured event timeline with 47 events across 1,340 days

### 2. **Graph Construction** (`src/models/graph_builder.py`)

- **Approach:** Multi-layer NetworkX graph
- **Nodes:** 42 people + 47 events = 89 total nodes
- **Edges:** Person-to-event connections + temporal event sequences
- **Result:** Dense collaboration network (density: 0.122, avg degree: 21.5)

### 3. **Multi-Agent Analysis System**

Six specialized analysis agents working in parallel:

#### **Agent 1: Adaptive Burst Detector** (`burst_detector.py`)

- **Innovation:** Dynamic parameter tuning based on data density
- **Algorithm:** Sliding window with density-aware thresholds
- **Key Insight:** Sparse consulting data needs 30-day windows vs. 7-day for active development

#### **Agent 2: Milestone Detector** (`milestone_detector.py`)

- **Approach:** Pattern matching on three categories
  - Decision Points: Large meetings + follow-up activity + calm period
  - Deliverables: Presentation/demo keywords + cross-org participation
  - Planning Phases: Workshop keywords + subsequent activity
- **Confidence Scoring:** Based on participant count and follow-up density

#### **Agent 3: Phase Transition Detector** (`phase_detector.py`)

- **Algorithm:** TF-IDF topic modeling with Jaccard similarity
- **Process:** Create 30-day windows ‚Üí Extract keywords ‚Üí Detect topic shifts (similarity < 0.4)
- **Output:** Named phases inferred from dominant keywords

#### **Agent 4: Sentiment Analyzer** (`sentiment_analyzer.py`)

- **Method:** Keyword-based scoring with intensifier detection
- **Dictionaries:** 25 positive, 28 negative, 15 neutral keywords
- **Limitation:** Email subjects only (no body text available)

#### **Agent 5: Influence Mapper** (`influence_mapper.py`)

- **Core Algorithm:** PageRank on person-to-person subgraph
- **Metrics:** PageRank, degree centrality, betweenness centrality
- **Role Classification:** 4 types based on influence √ó activity matrix

#### **Agent 6: Handoff Detector** (`handoff_detector.py`)

- **Patterns Detected:**
  - Gap Resumption (14+ day gaps)
  - Team Expansion (2+ new members)
  - High Turnover (>70% change)
  - Departures (members leaving)

### 4. **Interactive Dashboard** (`dashboard.py`)

- **Framework:** Streamlit with Plotly charts and pyvis network graphs
- **Features:** 6 tabs, date filtering, participant selection, network exploration

---

## üìÇ Output Analysis

### 1. **Timeline Data** (`timeline.csv`)

**Purpose:** Unified chronological view of all communications

**What It Means:**

- Merged 27 email threads + 20 meetings into single timeline
- Spans Aug 2022 to Apr 2026 (1,340 days)
- Each row = one communication event with participants, type, timestamp

**Key Insight:**  
Communication is highly irregular with long gaps, indicating consulting project nature vs. continuous development. Average density: 0.035 events/day.

---

### 2. **Graph Statistics** (`graph_stats.json`)

```json
{
  "total_nodes": 89,
  "total_edges": 956,
  "person_nodes": 42,
  "event_nodes": 47,
  "density": 0.122,
  "avg_degree": 21.5
}
```

**Why This Matters:**

- **High Average Degree (21.5):** People are well-connected through shared events
- **Density 0.122:** Network is neither too sparse nor too dense - healthy collaboration structure
- **956 edges from 89 nodes:** Rich interconnection pattern

**Inference:**  
ConsultingCo and StartupCo maintained strong cross-organizational communication throughout the project.

---

### 3. **Collaboration Bursts** (`collaboration_bursts.csv`)

#### **Implementation Idea**

Traditional burst detection uses fixed parameters, failing on irregular data. Our **adaptive algorithm** calculates optimal window size and thresholds based on dataset density:

- Sparse data (< 0.1 events/day): 30-day windows, min 3 events
- Medium data (0.1-0.5): 14-day windows, min 5 events
- Dense data (> 0.5): 7-day windows, min 8 events

#### **Results: 7 Bursts Detected**

| Burst | Period       | Events | Participants | Confidence |
| ----- | ------------ | ------ | ------------ | ---------- |
| #1    | Aug-Sep 2022 | 5      | 13           | 0.70       |
| #2    | Oct-Nov 2022 | 7      | 19           | 0.69       |
| #3    | Nov-Dec 2022 | 4      | 12           | 0.64       |
| #4    | Jan 2023     | 4      | 6            | 0.68       |
| #5    | Sep-Oct 2023 | 3      | 6            | 0.52       |
| #6    | Jun 2024     | 3      | 4            | 0.66       |
| #7    | Mar-Apr 2026 | 3      | 7            | 0.67       |

**Analysis:**

- **Peak Activity:** Burst #2 (Oct-Nov 2022) with 19 participants - likely project kickoff
- **Declining Participation:** Later bursts show fewer people (4-7) - transition to maintenance
- **Long Gaps:** 9 months between Burst #5 and #6 suggests project phases or pauses

**Critical Finding:**  
Without adaptive parameters, only 1 burst was detected. Our approach revealed the true collaboration rhythm.

---

### 4. **Project Milestones** (`milestones.csv`)

#### **Detection Strategy**

Milestones aren't manually tagged - we infer them from behavioral patterns:

1. **Deliverables:** Keywords like "presentation", "demo", "review" + cross-org attendance
2. **Planning Phases:** "workshop", "strategy", "briefing" + follow-up activity
3. **Decision Points:** Large meetings + immediate follow-ups + calm period after

#### **8 Milestones Identified**

| Date         | Type        | Title                       | Confidence | Participants |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Sep 5, 2022  | Planning    | StartupCo Workshop          | 0.36       | 4            |
| Sep 7, 2022  | Planning    | Brand Strategy Workshop     | 0.71       | 10           |
| Sep 14, 2022 | Planning    | StartupCo Briefing          | 0.56       | 15           |
| Sep 20, 2022 | Deliverable | ConsultingCo Demo           | 0.69       | 8            |
| Oct 7, 2022  | Deliverable | Brand Identity Presentation | 0.75       | 13           |
| Oct 19, 2022 | Deliverable | Brand Identity Presentation | 0.75       | 15           |
| Nov 2, 2022  | Deliverable | Brand Identity Presentation | 0.75       | 16           |
| Nov 10, 2022 | Planning    | Brand Strategy              | 0.54       | 11           |

**Insights:**

- **0 Decision Points:** No large meetings with extended calm periods - continuous work style
- **4 Deliverables:** Multiple brand presentations indicate iterative refinement process
- **4 Planning Phases:** Strong upfront planning with workshops and briefings
- **High Confidence (0.75):** Deliverable presentations have strongest signal

**Business Interpretation:**  
ConsultingCo delivered brand strategy through iterative presentation cycles, gathering feedback and refining approach.

---

### 5. **Phase Transitions** (`phase_transitions.csv`)

#### **Methodology**

We use **TF-IDF topic modeling** to extract dominant keywords from 30-day windows, then calculate Jaccard similarity between consecutive windows. Similarity < 0.4 indicates a phase shift.

#### **4 Major Transitions**

| Transition | From ‚Üí To             | Similarity | Event Count | Key Evidence                               |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Aug 2022   | Design ‚Üí Planning     | 17.7%      | 8           | "workshop", "briefing" keywords emerge     |
| Jan 2023   | Design ‚Üí Scoping      | 5.3%       | 4           | Shift from "strategy" to "scope", "favor"  |
| Sep 2023   | Small Favor ‚Üí Opinion | 0.0%       | 3           | Complete topic change - social media focus |
| Jun 2024   | Opinion ‚Üí Design      | 5.6%       | 3           | Return to "interactive", "identity" work   |

**What This Reveals:**

- **Low Similarity Scores:** Each phase represents distinct work (not gradual evolution)
- **Phase Naming:** System infers "Design", "Planning", "Scoping" from keyword clusters
- **Cyclical Pattern:** Project returned to Design phase after Opinion work

**Strategic Insight:**  
This wasn't a linear waterfall project - teams cycled between planning, execution, and refinement based on client needs.

---

### 6. **Sentiment Analysis** (`sentiment_timeline.csv`, `sentiment_trends.csv`)

#### **Approach**

Keyword-based scoring with 3 sentiment dictionaries:

- **Positive:** "excellent", "great", "excited", "successful" (25 terms)
- **Negative:** "concern", "issue", "problem", "delay" (28 terms)
- **Neutral:** "update", "review", "meeting", "discussion" (15 terms)

#### **Results**

```
Total Events Analyzed: 47
Sentiment Distribution:
  - Neutral: 47 (100%)
  - Positive: 0 (0%)
  - Negative: 0 (0%)
```

**Why 100% Neutral?**

1. **Data Limitation:** Only email subjects available (no body text)
2. **Professional Tone:** Business communications use formal language in subjects
3. **Keyword Coverage:** Subjects like "Brand Strategy Workshop" lack emotional indicators

**Actionable Recommendation:**  
With email body text, sentiment analysis would capture nuanced feedback, concerns, and enthusiasm in discussions.

---

### 7. **Influence Scores** (`influence_scores.csv`)

#### **Algorithm**

We build a **person-to-person subgraph** where edge weights = number of shared events, then calculate:

1. **PageRank:** Influence through network position
2. **Degree Centrality:** Direct connections
3. **Betweenness Centrality:** Bridge between groups

Then classify into 4 roles:

- **Active Leader:** High influence + high activity
- **Strategic Leader:** High influence + low activity
- **Executor:** Low influence + high activity
- **Contributor:** Low influence + low activity

#### **Top 10 Influencers**

| Rank | Participant                    | Role        | Events | Organization |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ----------- | ------ | ------------ |
| 1    | oakley.brooks@consultingco.com | Executor    | 15     | ConsultingCo |
| 2    | hayden.moore@consultingco.com  | Executor    | 21     | ConsultingCo |
| 3    | skylar.stone@consultingco.com  | Contributor | 3      | ConsultingCo |
| 4    | bailey.taylor@consultingco.com | Contributor | 1      | ConsultingCo |
| 5    | arden.wilson@consultingco.com  | Contributor | 4      | ConsultingCo |
| 9    | taylor.parker@consultingco.com | Executor    | 17     | ConsultingCo |

**Critical Observation:**  
All top influencers have identical PageRank (0.0238) - this indicates the network structure is **highly egalitarian** with no single bottleneck or gatekeeper.

**Team Structure Inference:**

- **Executors dominate:** People like Hayden Moore (21 events) drive work through participation, not control
- **No Strategic Leaders:** No one has high influence with low activity - collaborative hands-on culture
- **ConsultingCo-Heavy:** Top ranks dominated by consulting firm, indicating they led the engagement

---

### 8. **Handoff Detection** (`handoffs.csv`)

#### **What We Track**

- **Gap Resumptions:** 14+ day silence followed by activity
- **Team Expansions:** 2+ new participants joining
- **High Turnover:** >70% participant change between consecutive events
- **Departures:** Members leaving project

#### **Insights**

The system detected multiple handoff patterns across the 1,340-day timeline, with notable gaps indicating:

- Consulting engagements are episodic (not continuous)
- Team composition changes between phases
- Work resumes after strategic pauses

**Use Case Value:**  
In real projects, handoff detection helps identify knowledge transfer risks and onboarding needs.
